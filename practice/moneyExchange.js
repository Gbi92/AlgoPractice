/*
Create a function that takes a string(text), looks for HUF values in it and replaces them to EUR values. The exchange rate should be 300 HUF for 1 EUR for simplicity. Please ask the mentor what kind of string to number conversion can you use.

Example cases:

moneyExchange("Apples cost 300 HUF in my city.");
Should return "Apples cost 1 EUR in my city.".
