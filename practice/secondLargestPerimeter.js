/*
Create a function called secondLargestPerimeter that

takes an array of triangles (triangles) as an input, (a triangle is represented by an array with 3 integers which are the length of its sides)
returns the index of the triangle which has the second largest perimeter
should return -1 if the size of the array is less than 2
note: you don't have to create a Triangle class and you might assume that all triangles are valid

Example cases:

secondLargestPerimeter([[2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]);
Should return 2, because the [7, 8, 9] triangle has the second largest perimeter

secondLargestPerimeter([[2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6]]);
Should return 0, because the [2, 3, 4] triangle has the second largest perimeter

secondLargestPerimeter([]);
Should return -1
